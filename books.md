- ** Modernist Cousine at Home (2012)**. The at home edition is an absolute
  milestone of modern cooking. It goes into depth of why things work, rather
  than recipe after recipe. Each recipe is presented in an amazingly aiding way
  that I've seen no other cookbook do. All I wish is that it was longer, but
  that's why there's a $500 set of those books. **5/5** (January 2014)
- ** Art of Capacity Planning (2008)**. A classic, and definitely an easy, short
  read.  But it feels like a hundred pages of common sense if you've been in
  modern web operations for a year at scale. There's a few interesting points in
  there I'll definitely carry with me, but in other regards it's not a book I'll
  remember much from in a few months. **2/5** (January 2014)
- ** The Design of Everyday Things (??)**.
- **Zero to One (2014)**
